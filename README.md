### Goal Of This Repository 
__The ultimate goal is to work in big tech companies.__  
> Documenting my study.  
> Setting up goals. 
> I have not narrowed down the TODO lists for my specific purpose yet but I am willing to recall what I learnt in my bachelor's.  

___    

### Priority of my study as a job-seeker
Skim over these [websites](#Materials-I-am-going-to-use) to recall fundamental computer science knowledge.   
Some of them will be implented into the toy projects that I am planning to conduct in the nearest future.    
I will pick one subjects from the list below and beat it.   
- __MINIMUM basic concepts of fundamental Computer Science__  
- __MAXIMUM practical algorithm capacity along with optimization of the algorithm__.   
  
> 1. Data Structure and Algorithm 
> 2. Django / C++
> 3. Toy Projects using Django with basic APIs 
> 4. DL / ML ( + Mathematics if needed )   
>   2.1. Solving [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) problems will be accompanied
> 5. Theory ( Database, OS, Network, OOP )

### Data Engineer Projects Inspiration
- Data Engineer Career related
  - Starting from a basic project to a practical project to predict the data 
  - [Reference Blog < in Korean > ](https://github.com/Team-Neighborhood/I-want-to-study-Data-Science/wiki/포트폴리오)
- General Projects 
  - My project will be based on the git-hub called Coding Interview University, which is on top popular github list  
  - [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/README.md)
    - I will have this repository more oriented to Data Engineering rather than software engineering 
    
___  

### Data related careers 
#### __What is data science?__ 
  - Almost everything that has something to do with data:Collecting, Analyzing, Modeling... yet the most important part is ___its applications__
#### __Data Analyst__/__Data Engineer__/__ML Engineer__/__Data Scientist__  
+ __Data Analyst__ : __Data Analyst__ processes data provided by __Data Engineers(Backend Developer)__. They manage and maintain data or data dash board. They also set and analyze KPI(핵심성과지표) to find out reasons of changes of it. If new function is added or there is a need to see a specific log, they design data logs. 
+ __Data Engineer__ : Collect and refine data from applications or web so __data analyst__ can make use of it easily. They also manage the flow of data and develope dashboard for __data analyst__ to use.  
Trend these days is  
> 1) Data Engineers with capacity of developing back-end  
> 2) Data Engineers with knowledge of ML/DL  
> 3) Data Engineers who maily work with data engineering   
+ __ML Engineer__ : They work with models in specific domains(Computer Vision, Natural Language Process) and _apply these models to products. 
+ __Data Scientist__ : Mainly focus on theretical study in R&D department. Deep and profound knowledge of stastics is needed. They also do the works that __ML engineers__(Design, Modify models, develope additional models) do 
+ There are also other careers that I can follow such as Gross Hacker(Focusing on self-development more than on product using queries), Data Visualizers(Not many positions open in the market)
